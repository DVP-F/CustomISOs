# CustomISOs

For each ISO i upload here, the result will be in a release.
Different types eg. Windows/Linux will be different branches

The end version will contain the base iso if that was used as well as any config files zipped as .rar, .zip, .7z, .tar.gz or similar, most likely multiple but not guaranteed.
